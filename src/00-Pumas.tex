\section{Pumas}
\begin{frame}{What is Pumas?}
    Pumas (\textbf{P}harmace\textbf{U}tical \textbf{M}odeling \textbf{A}nd \textbf{S}imulation)
    \parencite{rackauckas2020accelerated}
    is a suite of tools to perform quantitative analytics of various kinds
    across the horizontal of pharmaceutical drug development.
    The purpose of this framework is to bring efficient implementations of
    all aspects of the analytics in this domain under one cohesive package.
